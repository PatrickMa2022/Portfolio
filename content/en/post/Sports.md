The best sport in the world is... swimming for a multitude of good reasons. For one, swimming is a life saving skill and it is incredibly important to know how to swim. Number two is that it is one of the most watched sports in the olympics because of names like Michael Phelps and Katy Ledecky. Easier to measure improvement, helps with endurance and is incredibly fun.  It is also the only sport I have stuck with for a long time.
